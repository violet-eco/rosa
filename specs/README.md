# Rosa File Format Documentation

## Introduction
Rosa is a specialized binary format for distributing
programs across multiple platforms and architectures.
This comprehensive documentation provides an in-depth
understanding of the Rosa, including its structure,
header specifications, sections, instruction set,
memory layout and reloaction mechanisms.

## File Structure
A Rosa file consists of the following sections, with specific order:

### Header Section
> Please refer to the [header document](header.md) for specification documents.

The header section is located at the beginning of the file provides
crucial information about the binary.

### Code Section
> Please refer to the [code document](code.md) / [intermediate representation document](ir.md) for specification documents.

The Code Section of the Rosa file format holds the platform-independent and architecture-agnostic intermediate representation (IR) instructions of the Violet application's executable code. It enables efficient interpretation or translation at runtime.
