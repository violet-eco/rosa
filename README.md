Rosa, a fast and robust low-level language. ðŸŒ¸ ðŸš€

## What does Rosa really do?

In traditional systems, programs are distributed as binary and are only availeble for one specific platform (Windows, Linux, macOS, ...) with a specific architecture (x86, ARM, ...).

To prevent this and to make native programs more stable and secure, Violet applications are distributed as Violet Pre-compiled Programs (VPP) using a special very low-level language called **Rosa**.

Rosa is very similar to WebAssembly: compressed very low-level source files that are built ahead of time on the machine that will run it. This enables several advantages:
- Programs are multi-platform and multi-architecture
- Programs run faster thanks to being optimized for the specific machine they will run on
- Programs are still very fast to compile
- Source code is protected for closed-source applications as Rosa is made of basic instructions
